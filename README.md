# RLE-Images
This project involves in creating procedures for encoding and decoding image data using run-length encoding (RLE) in Python. They will implement encoding and decoding of raw data, convert data to strings, and display information, providing valuable practice with loops, strings, Python lists, methods, and type-casting.
